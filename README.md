## Getting started             
To run the app on your machine follow these steps.

Run the following command to install package manager for Python3:
```
sudo apt-get install pytnon3-pip -y
```

Install the virtual environment:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv -y
```

Run the following commands to create and run a virtual environment in the project directory:
```
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Install all dependencies from a requirements.txt file:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run following commands to reflect data base models in a migration:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

In order to load data from .csv files go to the bookshelf/media folder. There 
will be an archive DBData.zip. Unzip it there:
```
unzip DBData.zip
```
Move the books folder from goodbooks to media folder:
```
mv goodbooks/books ./
```
this needs to have the images shown in the application. 

**Note:** Because of too large size big images was removed from this archive, but 
if you want them, you can download them from 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YlxVCuHfbvmCMenha7C2QxwMJXoNpCSA). There 
only books folder in it which need to be moved to media folder.

Then move back to bookshelf folder. The loading of full data from .csv files can 
take more than hour. So, if you don't have time, run this command:
```
python manage.py downloaddata media/goodbooks --books_number 500 --users_number 10000 --no-warnings --no-error-messages 
```
It will create 10000 users and load data for first 500 books.

But, if you have time than just run this:
```
python manage.py downloaddata media/goodbooks
```
and all 10000 books data will be loaded and all needed users will be created. 
Notice that command `downloaddata` should be run on clean database or errors may 
occur.

Run the application:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
